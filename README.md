Flavour Fusion is an AI-powered web application that automatically generates 
detailed recipe blogs based on user input. The platform allows users to enter a 
recipe topic and desired word count, and it generates a complete blog post 
including ingredients, preparation steps, cooking tips, and a friendly introduction. 
The system uses Google Generative AI (Gemini API) for content generation 
and Streamlit for building the interactive web interface. 
This project demonstrates the integration of Generative AI into real-world 
applications for content automation. 

Technologies Used:

• Frontend – Streamlit 
• Backend – Python 
• AI Model – Google Gemini 1.5 Flash 
• Environment Variables – dotenv
